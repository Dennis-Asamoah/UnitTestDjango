This a simple django blog rest api serving a react application.
It uses JWT for authentication and has permissions set on views.
The views contains both  class and function based views (CBV and FBV) basically 
doing the same thing.  
the path 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/doc/' gives you a documentation of the api (paths, views, etc).
(Assuming app will be run locally) 


The main project is called the Blog 
It contains two simple django apps. baseapp and baseapi

The baseapp contains a model which contains two models (User and Post)
The baseapp also contains tests.py.
The test.py  contains tests that specifically tests all the operations on the model. 
A library called coverage was used to do the test. It identifies classes and functions to test.
(coverge run manage.py test)

the baseapi contains the views of the applications, serializers
and the a tests.py file.
These tests specifically test the views of the api.Again coverage was used to  identify 
classes and functions to test.

Uncommenting permission_classes will actually make the test behave differently. This was 
deliberately done to have idea about what parameters makes our test fail.By default all tests
are passed. Try uncommenting permission_classes and some tests will fail.

** to start the app. Inyour virtual enviroment install the packages needed as follows:
pip install -r requirements.txt
